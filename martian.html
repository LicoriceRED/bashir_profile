                            The origin of how I got into
                            coding was my interest creating 
                            tools to help me as a camera
                            technitian in the film industry.

                        My major project for 2 years was slowly builting a laser and ultrasonic rangefinder system for tracking actors on screen. this tool helps with always keeping the subject in focus at all times with a live feed going wirelessly to the focus puller.
